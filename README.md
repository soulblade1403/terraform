# TERRAFORM
Learning terraform for automation aws

### Step by step

- Create Credentials of AWS

```bash vi ~/.aws/credentials ```
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = 
aws_secret_access_key = 
```

- The ```bash terraform init``` command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.
